# Vincent Delegated Trade Manager

#### This monorepo contains packages that are used to drive the _Vincent Delegated Trade Manager_ system.

## ‚ùå Installation

**Packages in this repository are currently not published to NPM; it is expected to be deployed as a
worker to Heroku and client to Vercel.**

## üéÆ Usage

#### To prepare for either production usage or local development, you must install dependencies and build the packages.

```zsh
pnpm install && pnpm build
```

#### For local development:

Note that local development uses `dotenvx` to load necessary environment vars from a `.env` file
which must be located
in the root directory of the repository to be loaded.

```zsh
pnpm dev
```

#### For production:

Note: Production does **not** use `dotenvx`. Define environment variables as secrets injected into
the running environment, rather than putting them on the filesystem of the running service.

```zsh
pnpm start
```
